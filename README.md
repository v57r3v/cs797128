First Year Integrative Seminar 2 
PUFY   1013 
Spring / 2025 
Course Description 
This course aims to challenge old beliefs about what you can   do with writing.   It   invites   inquiry   and helps      you to think about research as an energizing practice.   In   Integrative   Seminar   2 you will be   encouraged to   pursue topics you find perplexing, fascinating…maybe even a bit frightening. How can curiosity lead you   to ask productive questions and get answers to them?   How can you   develop   a writing   process that   is organic and unfolds over time?
In the first half of   the semester quick assignments will introduce you to a variety of research methods and       help you to define an area of   interest. In the second   half of   the   semester you will pursue your   own research based project, in connection with your Studio work. Throughout the semester, you will read texts which explore a wide array of   forms that researched writing can take.
Once again, Studio and Seminar will come together through a series of bridge projects that highlight the components of the research process: inquiry, context, investigation, interpretation, argument, connections and reflection. Bridge projects are the basis of the collaborative relationship of ideas between the two courses. They ask you to engage with    writing as a form. of making, and making as a form of thinking, in order to explicitly and productively blur the boundaries between Seminar and Studio. 
Class    Description - Visual Culture 
Meaning is embedded in the endless images, spaces, and   artifacts   that   make   up   our visual culture–what we see around us. How can we learn to look beneath the surface   and   see what’s being communicated through a broad range of   forms – art,   advertisements, products,   fashion, photography, illustration, architecture, performance, technology, etc. What new and unexpected   forms demand our scrutiny? 
In this class we will explore how to translate the visual into writing, how to create visuals with   words, and ultimately how to make a fial product that embodies the best of   both written   and visual elements.

● Authorship 
● Critical Analysis

Bridge Project Summary Bridge projects are the heart of   the Integrative Studio-Seminar pairing. These projects will   “bridge”   the   ideas, questions and content between these two courses. The following units   are   explored in   Studio   and   Seminar:
Bridge   1: Inquiry 
Bridge 2: Context + Investigation 
Bridge 3: Interpretation + Argument 
Bridge 4: Connections 
Bridge 5: Reflection and Final Presentations 
BRIDGE 1: Inquiry → Neighborhoods Tour (weeks 1-3): 
Learn about NYC through its design elements, motifs, and styles using observation, recording, and experience In Studio, you will create a Neighborhood Portfolio and then   Poster   inspired by   a   collection   of drawing,   photography, notes, audio and video of design motifs after visiting   an   assigned   neighborhood.   Brighton   Beach, Harlem, Jackson Heights, and   Flushing.
In Seminar, you will write two different versions of a neighborhood walking tour, guiding readers
through their assigned neighborhood and incorporating sensory details   and figurative language. With this   assignment, we will begin to make conscious choices in the process of crafting structures out   of   language.    We will also begin to get comfortable with drafting and revision.
Version 1 due Week 2 - Sunday, 2/2 
Version 2 due Week 3 - Sunday, 2/9

BRIDGE 2: Context + Investigation → Pavilion Ship (weeks 4-7): 
Explore materials, space, location and scale through research and building a model, then imagine that model as a spaceship. 
In Studio, you will research and design a pavilion,   in   a   particular   place   in NYC   (can be   a   place you visited   in Bridge   1 or someplace new). The purpose of   this   new   structure   is to   see, to   look,   and   to view. After identifying location, propose materials and design to support your goals.   Finally, build   a   model.
In Seminar, you will write a short science fiction story, imagining that your   pavilion   is   a   self-contained “ship” and describing what life is like on that ship. With this assignment, we will continue to   use language as a creative tool while also engaging in a   more   deliberate   drafting   process.

BRIDGE 3: Interpretation + Argument → Annotated Bibliography (weeks 8-9): 
Develop a thesis question byfollowing your curiosity, then conduct initial research on a question/topic of your choosing. 
In Studio, you will craft a question to answer through   a   creative,   research-based project. You will brainstorm ideas and then narrow to one topic and one   question that   can be tested through   making.
In Seminar, you will conduct exploratory research in line with your interests and curiosities   and write   an annotated bibliography–a written documentation of   your research and exploration. With this assignment, we will continue to practice the revision process and familiarize ourselves with the   standards   and practices of artistic and academic research.

代做程序编程语言 in a zine. 
In Studio, you will create a Final Project to be   shared with the   class. The   scope   of each project will be   individual and be determined in consultation with your Studio teacher.
The final Seminar project is divided into two major outputs.   First,   students will write   a   3-5 page Artist’s
Statement that addresses the methods, materials, and process used in their   final   Studio   project,   as well   as their broader    motivations, inspirations, and intentions as an   artist. This   statement will   also   discuss   and incorporate research from Bridge 3. Then, students will *remediate* their   Artist’s   Statement into   a   Zine, which will incorporate visual imagery and previous writings from this class. Both the   Statement and   the   Zine   will adhere to the Chicago Manual of Style. for citations and formatting.   Ultimately,   these   Zines will be submitted to a public collection.
1st Draft Artist’s Statement due Week 11 - Sunday, 4/13 
2nd Draft Artist’s Statement due Week 12 - Sunday, 4/20 
Zine due Week 14 - Sunday, May 4th

Expectations, Commitments and Community Agreements 
This course is not a performance given by me, your teacher, nor   a process   of   transmitting   information
from my brain to yours; rather, this course is a learning community where knowledge is co-created.   This         means that you yourself are an integral part of cultivating an environment where learning is both possible   and enjoyable.
On the first day of class, we will work together to build our own community agreements and   make
commitments to ourselves and to each other. These will be added to the   syllabus   and   referred   to   as   needed   throughout the semester.
ON DIVERSITY, EQUITY  INCLUSION 
In order to build community together, it is essential that students from   all backgrounds   and perspectives feel welcomed and valued. Racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, xenophobia,   ableism, ageism, classism, and any other forms of oppressive attitudes will   not be   tolerated. We         each bring unique talents, inquiries, knowledge, skills, and personal experiences that contribute      to creating a robust and welcoming learning community in which we   all   can belong and   thrive   to   our fullest potential. 
As much as possible, we will … 
…create a supportive, welcoming, and respectful classroom environment …be fully present in class (not on phones, not   doing   unrelated work)
…take advantage of a   10-15 minute break each class to refresh our   minds   and bodies …review vocabulary regularly and encourage vocabulary practice and retention
…address grammar issues as they arise
…utilize office hours, before/after class and by appointment
...accommodate the need for physical movement   and other needs   during   sustained   attention:
Acceptable “Fidgets” 
● Friendship bracelets 
● Tiny models 
● Embroidery 
● Clay/slime 
● Cross stitch 
● Doodling 
● Cat’s cradle (for one person)
